        <p><a class="project-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.excelinteriorsmn.com/">Excel Interiors</a> 
            specializes in re-upholstery, repair and refinishing of furniture. 
            I gave them a complete re-design of their existing website to offer 
            a more clean and modern feel using:
            <br>
                - Wix
                <br>
                - 123 Form Builder
            <br>
            <br>
            The <bold><italic>homepage</italic></bold> features a full-width carousel which displays popular 
            navigational options for ease of use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex">
        <img class="EI" src="./img/Excel Interiors/EIService.png" />
        <p>The <bold><italic>service pages</italic></bold> feature left aligned high resolution images 
            coupled with content that describes each service and a list of 
            work that's offered within that particular service.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex">
        <img class="EI" src="./img/Excel Interiors/EIblog.png" />
        <p>
            The <bold><italic>blog page</italic></bold> displays the most recent blog post at the top with 
            a convenient right sidebar for users to browse and read through older posts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I included a blog for SEO purposes, because the websites content is made 
            to be clean, simple and to the point, so it doesn't confuse users.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex">
        <img class="EI" src="./img/Excel Interiors/EIgallery.png" />
        <p>
            The <bold><italic>gallery page</italic></bold> features a full-width carousel to keep the 
            aesthetic features of the homepage.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex">
        <img class="EI" src="./img/Excel Interiors/EIContactPage.png" />
        <p>
            The <bold><italic>contact page</italic></bold> clearly displays Excel Interiors' contact information 
            and their hours of operation.
            <br>
            <br>
            An important feature Excel Interiors wanted was an image uploading option 
            to allow customers to send pictures of their furniture for estimates, so I 
            included exactly that.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the bottom, I embedded Google Maps for users to easily locate the business 
            relative to where they live.
